Source code of the Android RenderScript Demos which I showed and used for my presentation at the Mobile Tech Con 2011.

Some samples are based on code from daoki2 http://code.google.com/p/renderscript-examples/ which is mentioned at the top of the source code files.

Compile and run on an Android 3.x tablet. This will NOT work on the emulator as it doesn't support RenderScript at all.
